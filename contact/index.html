<p>The best way to contact me is by email at <a href="mailto:daniel@danieloaks.net">daniel@danieloaks.net</a> and I'm on most IRC networks as either <tt>dan-</tt> or <tt>dan_</tt></p>

<p>I keep most of my coding projects on my <a href="https://github.com/DanielOaks">Github</a> account, though there are quite a few forks on there. That's an unfiltered stream of the personal projects I'm working on day-to-day, so don't take everything on there too seriously.</p>

<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/DanielOaks">Soundcloud</a> is where I put most of my music. Again, it's fairly unfiltered compared to the list I've put up here.</p>
