short_description: "This is an interesting tune. A friend convinced me to spend a while trying to improve my the drums in my tracks. So I spent a couple weeks/months mostly focusing on my keydrums, and came up with this. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out, even if there is still so much more to learn!"
