short_description: Logo for an old community website
---
This was a community website I was asked to create a logo for years ago.

The site itself was primarily a Japanese-English community discussion board and site, which is why the logo has 'Japanese' in both languages. The red dot on the left represented the Japanese flag, with the two arrows *meant* to represent the two languages. However, they mostly end up being a visualisation of the '360' part of the name, since I based my design on the existing community name rather than creating one from scratch.

The site itself is lost to the annals of time, but I found these old files on one of my hard drives and thought I'd share them. I always did like how this logo turned out!
