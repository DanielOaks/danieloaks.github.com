short_description: Web designer and tool developer with Bibliotheca Anonoma
---
Since November 2014, I have been working with the Bibliotheca Anonoma in terms of web development and Python programming.

I’ve build their website using the Jekyll static site generator, along with Compass+SASS for the stylesheet handling, along with Github Pages for quick, affordable hosting.

I’ve been involved with both the BASC-py4chan and the BASC-Archiver projects, to allow users to easily build projects that interact with the 4chan API through a Pythonic interface, and a tool that lets users archive and backup imageboard threads.

The organisation is on Github, and shows the range of projects I have been involved with in Bibliotheca Anonoma.
