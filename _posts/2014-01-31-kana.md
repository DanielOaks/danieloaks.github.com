short_description: Simple Japanese Kana poster
---
This is a simple poster showing off the Japanese Hiragana, Katakana, and Numbers – similar to something you would see in a classroom.

I decided to try making one up myself, and see how it is designing something when you have a very clear structure in mind already.
