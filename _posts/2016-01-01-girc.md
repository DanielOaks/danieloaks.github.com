short_description: A simple, modern IRC client library written for Python3, currently in development
---
girc is a Python IRC client library, written to use asyncio.

This library is designed to take advantage of the new asyncio library in Python 3. This is in order to provide a cleaner, more pythonic library that supports more modern IRC features.

This library is currently in development, being used in personal projects and for some Bibliotheca Anonoma activities.
