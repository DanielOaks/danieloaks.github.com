short_description: Creator of the Goshu IRC bot – a simple, powerful, flexible bot written in Python
---
Goshu is a Python-based IRC bot I've been developing on and off for the past few years.

Utilising simple YAML configuration files, a fast, extensible module system and useful, configurable logging, Goshu excels in creating bots with fun, easy-to-edit commands.

Goshu was written, initially, over the course of a few months to replace and replicate the functionality of a few other IRC bots. After a few revisions and rounds of updates, Goshu has a flexible, powerful feature-set, including built-in YAML-Python link recognition and data printing.
