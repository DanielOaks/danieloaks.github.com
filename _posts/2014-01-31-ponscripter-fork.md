short_description: Developer on the Ponscripter-fork visual novel engine for Narcissu, working with Sekai Project
---
Since March 2014, I have been helping develop the Ponscripter-fork visual novel engine, working with [Sekai Project](https://sekaiproject.com/) to improve and add new features to the engine, as well as working with the game community to incorporate requested features such as controller integration and blind accessibility.

I have also been contributing bug fixes to the game engine, making sure it builds under my platform, updating libraries where appropriate, and debugging issues reported by our community.

This engine has been used by [Sekai Project](https://sekaiproject.com/) in their English visual novel release, [Narcissu 1st & 2nd](http://store.steampowered.com/app/264380/). However, as it is an open source project, we anticipate that other projects based on the original Ponscripter engine can make use of our newly-updated and improved fork.

The engine code is freely available [on Github](https://github.com/sekaiproject/ponscripter-fork).
